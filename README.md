## Risk
- This project script is hosted on the world's largest github, open, transparent, and secure, and refuses any private chat scripts.
- The distribution of handling fees from the exchange in the script involves the exchange's apiKey, which must not be exposed to others.
- Private key accounts are very important! The script only runs on your own computer, and refuses any proxy interaction.
